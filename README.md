# Games Library Comparison App

## Development Description

This app is a work in progress. It's purpose will be to allow gamers, like myself, to compare their games lists with their friends. The MVP will be for Steam only, but I'll work to expand that to other platforms at some point post-MVP.

## Development Plan / Tasks To Do:

### To Do During Next Pairing Session:

#### Simpler Issues to Get the Rust OFf:

- Make username in the gamesTable a URL to the user's profile, instead of just plain text
- Image of profile picture displayed next to the user's name

- in other-controller, in the app.post /sharedGames we use sharedGamesArray to build the array, but we then simply send back sharedGames in the res.json. Maybe simplify the naming conventions there.

- Could CSS from GamesTable.scss be taken into base.scss file?

- keyCode is deprecated
#### Bigger Issues to Tackle int the Refactor:

- Deal with async issues with removing privateUsers from foundUsers

- Maybe do some async refactoring for performance gains

- Almost certainly an async issue: Sometimes a user's vanityUrl is not displayed on the header of the games table alongside the other users' vanityUrls. We believe this is a timing out of userString being built somewhere along the line.

- Consider if we can refactor how we phrase "foundUser" in MainPage.jsx and similar phrasing throughout the app to have more consistent terms, and be more readable / identifiable

- Got this error right as we were wrapping up last session. I was manually testing invalid Vanity URLs & private users. We had just made changes regarding how we display warnings about those:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'steamId' of null
[0]     at C:\Users\Samue\gt\sams-apps\games-comparison\controllers\user-games-api.js:50:41
[0]     at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)
[0]     at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5)
[0]     at async C:\Users\Samue\gt\sams-apps\games-comparison\controllers\user-games-api.js:44:7

- Heroku specific problem: On the free plan we're hitting the max of 3600 questions when we run comparisons for users with extremely large game libraries (800+). Specific breaking point currently is amusingmouse & sammysticks compared. That doesn't work. However, amusingmouse & dabigcheezey comparison will complete successfully. dabigcheezey owns only 30 games, but sammysticks owns 188. amusingmouse owns 846.

- Are we importing Bootstrap CSS the most ideal way? Current we pull in the CDN on index.html in the public folder

### 1st Major Refactor Plans: 

- DONE Combine SharedGamesTable & UserGamesTable into one component. 
1) DONE make a ternary statement in SharedGamesTable that handles whether there is 1 or more users
2) DONE Rename SharedGamesTable to GamesTable, delete UserGamesTable, then change all references to this in MainPage & SharedGamesTable
- DONE Refactor the compareGames function in MainPage.jsx. We may be able to remove the if/else surrounding it, especially once the SharedGamesTable & UserGamesTable are combined.
- DONE When rendering warnings to the website user about invalid Vanity URLs & private profiles, take into account whether there are 1 or multiple users that the warning is about

- Why do our components show up as "Anonymous" in the Components tab of the Dev Console? Is this a problem, or is this ideal (because we don't want our code public to the world)?
- DONE Look into using findOrCreate instead of create in CreateJoinRow in user-games-api. 
- DONE Implement findOrCreate anywhere else we can use. -- * Particular note here: big performance gains from what we changed in the user-games-api.js controller. We were able to drop 3 awaits while also combining 2 blocks of code into 1.
- Brian also suggested some specific SQL queries that could be used to eager load information.
- Speaking of eager load, would it be realistic to over-eager load a user's games list? We could first make sure that their profile & games list are public. We could display a warning if their profile is not public. Then we could pull the game's list & hold it in the background somehow, until the user hits Compare Games

- Consider how we can refactor states. Can we combine some of these? Should we reorder them to be more sequential? Are there any other improvements we can make?
- Strongly consider how our code can be best arranged to be readable. Are there blocks of code that execute before the block above? If so, we should probably move them into sequence in the code, to be more readable.
- Analyze all of our async/awaits, setTimeout, and other steps we've taken to deal with the async issues we had in the original version of this project

- DONE Show the number of games shared (suggestion from pita82, Sam's brother-in-law) -- we also now show the count of games owned by an individual user, when only 1 user is entered
- Consider renaming and/or reorganizing the controllers.

- Remember to use if we need to change things in the models / BD: Sequelize ".sync({ alter: true })" from [https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#:~:text=Models%20are%20the%20essence%20of,(and%20their%20data%20types)]

- Do we ever update a user's games list? We think so.
- Do we ever update a user's profile? We don't think so. Finding the right way to upsert might be the best. We've never done that.
- Do we use playtime? Not currently. We would likely need to either create a new many to many relationship for this to work, or completely change how our original tables are setup.

- Do we run createJoinRow (to make many to many relationships between games & users) every time a search is run? Is there a way to avoid this for a performance gain? See Line 85 on MainPage.jsx & about line 50 or so on user-games-api.js controller.

- Should appId be the primary key for our games table?
- Maybe add in a column for how many games each user owns - integer in steamuser table

- WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME BACK TO THIS after doing a tutorial or 2. --- Writing tests to automatically confirm that we haven't broken the program each time we change some code.
1) Figured out how to run tests. Done for FE. We'll have to figure it out for th backend when we get there.
2) Setup some initial FE tests.
Previous note on the need for tests: Should we write some tests to make sure functionality continues to work, without us having to manually test? I got thinking about this a lot from what we discussed during the Software Crafters meetings Thursday evening.

- As usual, review comments to make sure they're correct & useful. Delete commented out code that we no longer need to retain.

#### Errors to tackle in refactoring

- 8/18/2020 found possible bug: First time we searched MrMuscles3000 since changing models & doing force:true. For the first time in a really long time, we ended up getting this console.log("Could not load user information") from line 38 of other-controller.js. We aren't sure why. His games list may have still be used to compare games with the other 3 users.
    - Follow up on the previous comment. Same error happened in the same way when we searched ichinyan for the first time since clearing the DB.
    - More follow up: Sometimes user names don't appear in the table head even if they are still factored in to the logic that determines the shared games table. This is more likely to happen when the user is pulled into the DB the first time, but we've seen it happen at least 1 other time when a user was already in the database. That happened once with pita82, the 2nd day we used him as an example.
    - 9/15/2020 Even more follow up: We strongly assume that this has to do with the underlying syncronicty issues that caused us to write the setTimeout block of code in other-controller.js (about line 64 at this point). That res.json gets sent back to the front end before the table header is written to the DOM. We will need to figure out how to fix this.

- DONE Turn off loading wheel if all Vanity URLs are invalid
- FIXED Games table shows up with no games in the list, but the user name(s) listed at the top. This means if 1 user is private, and all others are public, then the list comes back empty.
- FIXED Repeated games happened for the first time I've ever seen: [./games-repeated.jpg] -- Possible solution: build some logic that determines if names or gameBanner's match. If they do, display only one of those games. This does NOT remove the duplicates (if they are indeed duplicates, and not slightly different versions or editions of the same game) in our database.
- FIXED How are we displaying to the user that a user's games list is private? We likely aren't doing this yet. Our warning is only if we didn't find the user. The loading wheel takes a long time to disappear if we search one user and his/her games list is private. Then the network tab said that sharedGames failed, in red text.
    - When hitting Steam's API, GetPlayerSummaries will return communityvisibilitystate. However, "there are only two possible values returned: 1 - the profile is not visible to you (Private, Friends Only, etc), 3 - the profile is "Public", and the data is visible." So if a profile is public, but the games list is private, we'll have to catch that a different way. That said, we could us this to initially note private profiles.
    - SOLUTION: We ultimately simply filtered out users who returned zero games in their list.

#### Refactoring Advice from Brian Freeman:

For performance. Some thoughts:

Remember database calls are expensive – like reading files from disk (as compared to in memory operations)

There is findOrCreate that can turn CreateJoinRow into a single step database call instead of find then create if not there. Can user attributes to limit data retrieved (If you only need the steamUserID for a given user use attribute to just get that ID). Think in “sets” for database instead of steps.  For instance you do

For each user – get their games
For each game – check if it’s contained in other user(s) games
Return set of shared games
This can be refactor to “return games shared by all (or at least 2) users” – Possibility is below:

Instead of GetUsers – gets all User data and includes (eager loads) all their games. Can get the aggregate of games that the users jointly own (either all own or at 2 own). In SQL I would use the following query(ies)

Select Game.name, Game.gameBanner, count(*) numUsers

from Game inner join SteamUserGames

on Game.appId=SteamUserGames.gameID

where steamUserID in (ID1, ID2…)

group by Game.name, Game.gameBanner 

having numUsers>1

My system isn’t setup to run the code local to try and refactor and test (I don’t have a steam apiKey), but it might be possible for us to do 1 or more pairing sessions and do some refactoring via zoom.

I hope this helps. Let me if you have questions or might want to try and pair up sometime.

#### Things We Like From https://www.lorenzostanco.com/lab/steam/friends
We found this website mid-August when someone we showed our app to brought it to our attention. He does a lot of things that we like. Some we'd already considered, and some things he had implemented before we thought of them. Here are some things we saw that we might want to implement:

- We really like how he shows games that multiple users, but not all, own.

#### Things We'd Do Differently From https://www.lorenzostanco.com/lab/steam/friends

- 

### Core programming tasks:

1) DONE Get the compare user button to dispaly a table of games for one user
- 1a) DONE Games list componenet 
- 1b) DONE Getting the data in correctly from backend (this is where we're stuck EOS 7/
- 1c) DONE Games component to display when (and only when) game data is loaded after the API call is made

2) Add user button needs to give us an option to compare additional users
- 2a) DONE The FE API requests we're doing need to be able to make requests for multiple users
- 2b) DONE Get all old API features brought into this newer version of the app
- 2c) DONE Add user button needs to add a new field to the DOM (cut off 10 unique users at once)
- 2d) DONE Need to make a state for the shared games, and pass that down in props to the SharedGamesTable.jsx
- 2e) DONE Bring it full cirlce & compare the users accurately

3) DONE Display table of games that all users share

4) DONE Pressing Enter should fire the search, same as if "Compare Games" is clicked with the mouse. Warning rendered on page if one of the users can't be found.

### Programming tasks after core functionality is achieved:

- Playtime is hard coded to the game for the first related user, not related to each user who owns the game
- Add the game's picture / icon next to it's name in the table(s) -- Model
- PARTIALLY CHANGED Consider showing a list of users compared. Showing their Steam username, profile pics, and/or Vanity URLs in a list of compared users might be best. 
- Checkout out what is returned by our calls to Steam's API, and see if we get more back that we want to use
- Checkout what else we can get from the Steam API, and see if we want to expand the site's function

- Don't list games such as "SMITE - Public Test" and "Dota 2 Test"
- Consider finding a way to have software not show up in the tables
- How to use page - explain the need for public Steam games list, how to find / create Vanity URL, etc.
- About Us page, or something similar, where we can intro ourselves & explain why we made this.
- Allow user to search using something other than their Vanity URL. Some don't have a Vanity URL. At the minimum we should explain how to find or create their Vanity URL.
- Let's make sure it's obvious to the user that they found the Steam users they were looking for. Showing their Steam username, profile pics, and/or Vanity URLs in a list of compared users might be best.
- For multiple users, show games that all users except 1 have. For example, if 4 users are entered, and 3 have Bannerlord, we can show that 3 of 4 own that game, in case the 4th wants to buy it to play with the rest.
- May move showing individual games lists to a later task. When we do that, we may want to initially hide those lists on mobile because that's not the main info someone comes to the site to look at.
- (More detials on the the previous bullet, copied & pasted from a different section.) Repeat multiple tables of games, one for each user. Make sure the tables of games of each user displays correctly & aesthically well; Check for responsiveness. We may want to have the tables cut off at 20 games, with an option to display more. Also may want to display the games in order of play time. However, I think that players may have their "hours played" stats set to private, even if the games list is visible.
- DONE Give users the option to go to the Steam store page for each game.
- Following the bullet above: Consider linking to the user's desktop Steam app & opening up the game in their game library. We would have to determine how to do that first.
- DONE Delete button now works almost fully as intended.

#### More things we can do with Steam's API:

- Get the friends list for any user that has that set to public: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetFriendList_.28v0001.29 --- We could use this to pull their friends, and allow them to select which ones they want to compare games with.

### Styling to do:

- DONE Display loading wheel similar to what David added to the handlebars version of the app.
- Use baseSCSS file for: DONE color variables, margin/padding variables, etc.
- Username input boxes to separate into 2 columns. Maybe we start with 2 boxes, 1 in each column. This would have to be developed with responsiveness in mind.
- DONE Add option to remove a username input line, down to only 1 user
- Consider moving the buttons to the top. Each time "Add User" is clicked, that button moves down. So if you try to double click the button, the button has moved away from your cursor before you hit it the second time. We can also consider moving the cursor with the button.
- Deal with the left shift that happens with the margins when the Shared Games table loads. --- We realized that this is actually happening because the scroll bar comes in. It would be interesting if we could figure out how to compensate for that.
- favicon
- Consider our margins between elements. We're mostly using 2% top margin, but use 1.5rem at one point because 2% wasn't doing what we wanted.

#### Table Styling:

- Figure how to get the text to wrap responsively, and still be centered with the image.
- Consider if we need the image to scale more than it does.
- Fix the lines between table rows -- We're mostly okay with the table lines between the rows, but the top line on the <th> bugs us a little.
- Consider rounding the corners of the table slightly
- When we enable users to look at the individual games list of each entered Steam user, we would want to make the styling a universal variable so it can be used by multiple table components. That, or we combine both table components into 1 component.

### Bugs to fix & already fixed:

- FIXED Live site time delay / timing out -- The problem was that we had changed the models, but hadn't had the live site's DB reset. We pushed a force:true, ran some searches, then pushed the code with the force:true out.
- FIXED: Since adding the delete button to the end of each input field, pressing enter no longer runs compare games. This may be fixed by changing that button to be a span. But I doubt that would fix it, because we already had multiple buttons when we changed enter to only activate compare games.
- DONE: Figure out how to delete the text from the input field when the delete button is pressed for that input field, and there are following input fields.
- FIXED: Fix formating for input rows now that delete button is implemented & working.
- FIXED: Loading wheel runs infinitely if all users entered are invalid. We don't have a test for compare games if it's run with all invalid users.
- FIXED: Remove users not found from SharedGamesTable header

### Notes for future refactoring:

- Live site warning: "Mixed Content: The page at 'https://comparegameslibrary.herokuapp.com/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image 'http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/4700/fcd1abd6380998e473b92690e28a9fe0a1a27b8d.jpg'. This content should also be served over HTTPS."
- Do we need both usersToSearch & searchedUsers as separate states? Or could we refactor this by deleting one of those, and only using the other.
- Is it best practice to setup usersToSearch as an object, then change it to an array to pass it to the backend? Should it be an array throughout, or an object throughout?
- If any of the user states are blank strings, the search will run as a Shared Games search. -- Maybe we solve this by deleting that index position in the array when the string is deleted by the user.
- Check for a user being double entered. That doesn't break the search, but it'd be nice to not have that user double entered in our system
- FIXED: Add user button re-runs the search without anything else being clicked
- Add err handling. Need to tell user why certain things didn't work.
- Resolve all warnings in the browser console.
- See if we can resolve the depracation warning in the BE console. This one: (node:31268) [SEQUELIZE0004] DeprecationWarning: A boolean value was passed to options.operatorsAliases. This is a no-op with v5 and should be removed.
- Currently all FE API calls happen in MainPage.jsx. We should probably move the API requests to a separate file or files, then import them to MainPage.
- Consider combing SharedGamesTable & UserGamesTable into 1 component.
- Currently we're using createJoinRow() in our controller to create the many to many relationship between users & games, but also to just give us an error if we try to duplicate an existing relationship. This is intentional, because it prevents us from having to first check if the relationship already exists. This makes a 2 step process (checking, then creating if it doesn't exist) into a 1 step process (just letting Sequelize do both). However, this may not be best practice. Consider & research if it needs to changes.
- In other-contoller, towards the end, we have this: app.post("/sharedGames", function (req, res) { getUsers(res, req.body.usersArray, (usersArray).... etc. This bigger block of code has a lot of loops inside loops. How can we refactor this?
- DONE: Discuss NPM audit fix with David
- FIXED: Also discuss the lodash security warning I'm getting on GitHub
- Let's also revisit server.js

Minor tasks we can repeat periodically during development:
- Clean up any unused code, packages, etc.
- Clean up the FE & BE console logs.
- Improve code comments


**Think about how users could use & misuse this app.** We probably have a lot more refactoring that we can do besides what is noted above.

### Models:

#### Changes that need to happen to models:

headerImage could be changed to just gameBanner or gameIcon
delete windows, mac, linux because we have no use for that
capture playtime from the Steam API


### Notes About Controllers:

Notes to self 7/20/2020:

I pulled the routes from the old handlebars version of the app. Some of this for sure needs to change, because we're not server side rendering in this updated, react version of the app. So I have commented out the res.render lines of code, an replaced most of them with res.json.

A big observation we had was that these controllers are intertwined. We may want to separate the exported functions to their own files to "separate concerns". Then it'll be more readable, I'd hope.

### Notes About Frontend API Calls:

I setup a utils folder with an api js file (named frontend-api.js). However, we're not using that yet. I'll leave it there as a reminder for now. I will proceed with the writing the axios functions inside the react containers / components first, and may export those later. I'll have to research what is best practice for these kind of things.

## UI / UX Thought Process:

We decided not to display a warning to the user that they need to search with at least one input field completed. That seems instinctive that nothing would happen if they didn't enter any username. We spent time working on other code.

## Lessons learned:

It looks like I don't need Axios installed in both the client & the root folders. It may only need to be in the root folder. That's how we had it for Job Init.

We had to uninstall Axios from the front end to get the first FE Axios.post we wrote to go the backend for the information we were sending.
